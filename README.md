Ray Blaster Pack

- Faceplate pieces stack and glue together. Print with supports.

- Everything else prints without supports.

- Sideplates use m3x16mm screws


Patch Side Plates

- Shouldn't need support if you have good bridging

- Glue 3x2 rectangle of soft side velcro into the recess

- I recommend cutting out holes in the velcro for the 2 screws they will cover

- Add morale patch(es) for blaster swag
