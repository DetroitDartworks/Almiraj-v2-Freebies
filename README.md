Ray Blaster Pack

- Faceplate pieces stack and glue together. Print with supports.

- Everything else prints without supports.

- Sideplates use m3x16mm screws


Patch Sideplates

- Shouldn't need support if you have good bridging
- Glue 3x2 rectangle of soft side velcro into the recess
- I recommend cutting out holes in the velcro for the 2 screws they will cover
- m3x16mm scrrews
- Add morale patch(es) for blaster swag


Nuka Cola Sideplates
- Shouldn't need supoprt if you have good bridging
- m3x16mm screws
- Works well on the "Face Plate Muzzle" from the original fileset and with the Ray Blaster Faceplate from the Ray Blaster pack
